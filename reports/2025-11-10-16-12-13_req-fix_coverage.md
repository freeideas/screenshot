## Response

## Coverage Analysis Complete

**One significant issue found and fixed:**

- **File:** reqs/capture-by-title.md
- **Before:** Missing coverage for behavior when multiple windows share the same title (README.md line 22: "If a window title is provided and multiple windows share the same title, one will be captured")
- **After:** Added $REQ_CAPTURE_TITLE_006: "If a window title is provided and multiple windows share the same title, screenshot.exe must capture one of those windows."
- **Why:** This is a reasonably testable behavior -- when duplicates exist, the application should successfully capture one window rather than failing or erroring. The requirement focuses on the observable behavior (successful capture) without overspecifying which one gets captured (that remains unspecified as the README states).

All other important testable behaviors from the READMEs are now properly covered in the requirements files.
