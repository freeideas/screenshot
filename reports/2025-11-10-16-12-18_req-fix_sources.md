**No significant issues found.** All requirements have proper source attribution.

All 18 requirement IDs across the 4 requirement files (help-mode.md, capture-by-title.md, capture-by-id.md, and test-verification.md) contain correct source attributions that follow the required format and accurately reference the appropriate sections in either ./README.md or ./readme/TESTING.md.
