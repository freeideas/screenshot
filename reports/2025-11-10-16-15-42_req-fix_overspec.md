## Response

## Summary

**One significant over-specification issue was found and fixed:**

**File:** reqs/test-verification.md

**Before:** 
```
$REQ_OUTPUT_002: Non-Empty Output File
The output PNG file must contain valid image data (non-zero size).
```

**After:**
```
$REQ_OUTPUT_002: Output PNG Format
The output file must be in PNG format.
```

**Why:** The README.md Technical Details section only states "Outputs PNG format". The original requirement added extra details about "valid image data" and "(non-zero size)" that are not specified in the README. While TESTING.md mentions verifying non-zero file sizes, that's a testing approach, not a requirement from the README. The requirement was over-specified by adding implementation and verification details not present in the source documentation.

All other requirements in help-mode.md, capture-by-id.md, and capture-by-title.md correctly match the README detail level without over-specification.
