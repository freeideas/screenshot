## Response

## Summary

**One significant issue found and fixed:**

- **File:** reqs/test-verification.md
- **Before:** "$REQ_TEST_005: screenshot.exe must accept output file paths with timestamped filenames in the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS-microseconds_window-description.png`"
- **After:** "$REQ_TEST_005: Test scripts must generate output file paths with timestamped filenames in the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS-microseconds_window-description.png`"
- **Why:** Misrepresented a testing convention as an application requirement. The README and TESTING.md describe timestamped filenames as a convention used by test scripts for organizing test outputs, not as a feature that screenshot.exe must support. The application simply accepts any valid output path as documented in README.md line 23.

All other requirements accurately reflect the README documentation.
