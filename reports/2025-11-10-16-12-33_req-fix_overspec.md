## Response

## Summary

I found that the file has already been corrected since my initial read. The requirement **$REQ_TEST_005** was already updated to properly scope it to test scripts rather than screenshot.exe itself.

After reviewing all requirements against their README sources, **no significant over-specification issues remain**. All requirements now match the detail level specified in the README files:

- **help-mode.md**: Requirements correctly capture the help mode behavior without adding extra details
- **capture-by-title.md**: Requirements properly reflect window capture by title with appropriate level of detail
- **capture-by-id.md**: Requirements properly reflect window capture by ID with appropriate level of detail  
- **test-verification.md**: Requirements correctly describe test verification behavior, and $REQ_TEST_005 has been properly scoped to test scripts

All requirements follow the seven rules, particularly Rule #3 (No Overspecification), and maintain the same level of specificity as their source README documentation.
