## Response

Now I'll analyze each requirement against the README documentation to check for accuracy:

## Analysis Complete

**No significant issues found.** The requirements accurately reflect the README documentation.

All requirements properly:
- Match the documented behavior in README.md and readme/TESTING.md
- Include correct source attributions citing the appropriate README sections
- Use unique requirement IDs with the correct format
- Describe reasonably testable behaviors
- Avoid inventing behaviors not in the documentation
- Avoid overspecification beyond what the README states

The requirements correctly capture:
- Help mode behavior (display usage and list windows when run without exactly 2 arguments)
- Window capture by ID (alphanumeric IDs that uniquely identify windows)
- Window capture by title (with proper handling of multiple windows sharing the same title)
- Output file requirements (PNG format, non-zero size, includes decorations)

No corrections needed.
