## Response

## Analysis Complete

**No significant issues found.** All important testable behaviors from the README files are covered in the requirements.

The requirements properly cover:
- Help mode and window listing (help-mode.md)
- Capture by window ID (capture-by-id.md)
- Capture by window title (capture-by-title.md)
- File output creation and validation (test-verification.md)

Items correctly excluded from requirements (per the rules):
- AOT compilation and build process -- build instructions, not runtime requirements
- Testing methodology and AI verification approach -- test infrastructure, not application behavior
- Test filename conventions -- test tooling, not application behavior
- Development/build prerequisites -- not runtime requirements

All seven rules for requirements are being followed, and coverage is complete for reasonably testable runtime behaviors.
