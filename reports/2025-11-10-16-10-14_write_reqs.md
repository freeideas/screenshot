## Response

## Requirements Generation Complete

I've successfully created testable requirement flows based on the documentation in `./README.md` and `./readme/TESTING.md`.

### Summary

- **README files processed:** 2
  - `./README.md`
  - `./readme/TESTING.md`

- **Flow files created:** 4

### Created Flow Files

1. **`./reqs/help-mode.md`** -- Help mode flow that displays usage information and lists currently open windows when run without arguments (3 requirements)

2. **`./reqs/capture-by-title.md`** -- Capturing screenshots by specifying window title, including accepting arguments, capturing the window, and saving as PNG with decorations (5 requirements)

3. **`./reqs/capture-by-id.md`** -- Capturing screenshots by specifying window ID, including accepting arguments, capturing the window, and saving as PNG with decorations (5 requirements)

4. **`./reqs/test-verification.md`** -- Test verification flow covering file creation, file size validation, capture methods, and timestamped filename support (5 requirements)

### Total Requirements: 18

All requirements follow the seven rules:
- Complete coverage of testable behaviors
- No invention beyond documentation
- No over-specification
- Tell complete stories from start to end
- Source attribution for every requirement
- Unique requirement IDs
- Reasonably testable behaviors only
